# ACP_Ray2

This library contains types, functions and variables used in Rayman 2 (PC) and the ACP (*Architecture Commune de Programmation*) engine.

It is not a complete reimplementation of the engine - its goal is to simplify calling/detouring functions and accessing game objects in custom tools and mods.

Full modding API is not yet available. Function hooking requires MS Detours or a similar library, custom DLLs can be injected using [Ray2Fix](https://github.com/spitfirex86/Ray2Fix).
